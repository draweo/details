**details.py** was a task set as part of the HyperionDev Bootcamp.

A 'user input and collated output' task, asking for several details from a user, then printing out a single sentence including all these details.

Problem solving came into play here, as (although not required to by the task) I wanted to ensure all names printed began with capital letters,
even if the user had input those names entirely in lower case.
